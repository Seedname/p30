	    <h1>Poetry 30/30 Home Page</h1>
	    <p>Welcome to the Poetry3030.com's homepage! During the month of April, the day's format will be posted here.</p>
	 <div id = "aformatd">
		 <h1>Format Descriptions</h1>
		 <p>This section of the home page allows you to view descriptions and examples of the formats throughout the month quickly and easily. If you still didn't understand the format of the day, click <a href = "https://poetry3030.com/p30-1">here.</a>
		 <h2 id = "cacophony">Cacophony</h2>
		 <h3>Cacophony: A harsh discordant mixture of sounds.</h3>
		 <p>Poems based on cacophony sound typically have hard-to-pronounce letter combinations that can twist your tongue when read aloud. The right choice of words can really make a cacophony poem stand out.</p>
		 <h2>Elegy</h2>
		 <h3>Elegy: A poem of serious reflection, typically a lament for the dead.</h3>
		 <p>Elegies are usually about mourning the loss of a loved one, but occasionally it can be used for self-reflection. For beginners, elegies can be written about the loss of something you desired. </p>
		 <h2>Free Verse</h2>
		 <h3>Free Verse: Poetry that does not rhyme or have a regular meter.</h3>
		 <p>Free verse poems will bend over their backs if you tell them to. The poet can format their poem however they like to- rhyme or no rhyme, metaphors or not- free verse's are, well, free!</p>
		 <h2>Ghazal</h2>
		 <h3>Ghazal: Originally an Arabic verse form dealing with loss and romantic love, then embraced by Persian poets.</h3>
		 <p>"The ghazal is composed of a minimum of five couplets—and typically no more than fifteen—that are structurally, thematically, and emotionally autonomous. Each line of the poem must be of the same length, though meter is not imposed in English. The first couplet introduces a scheme, made up of a rhyme followed by a refrain. Subsequent couplets pick up the same scheme in the second line only, repeating the refrain and rhyming the second line with both lines of the first stanza. The final couplet usually includes the poet's signature, referring to the author in the first or third person, and frequently including the poet's own name or a derivation of its meaning."</p>

		 <h2>Haiku</h2>
		 <h3>Haiku: A traditional form of Japanese poetry</h3>
		 <p>"Haiku poems consist of 3 lines. The first and last lines of a Haiku have 5 syllables and the middle line has 7 syllables. The lines rarely rhyme."</p>

		 <h2>Ode</h2>
		 <h3>Ode: A lyric poem in the form of an address to a particular subject, often elevated in style or manner and written in varied or irregular meter.</h3>

		 <h2>Prose Poem</h2>
		 <h3>Prose Poem: A piece of writing in prose having obvious poetic qualities, including intensity, compactness, prominent rhythms, and imagery.</h3>
		 <p>Prose poems don't look like poems, but paragraphs, since they don't have any obvious lines or stanzas, but prose poems contain poetic devices that are obvious and distinguish a prose poem from a paragraph.</p>
		 <h2>Sestina</h2>
		 <h3>Sestina: A poem with six stanzas of six lines and a final triplet, all stanzas having the same six words at the line-ends in six different sequences that follow a fixed pattern, and with all six words appearing in the closing three-line envoi.</h3>
